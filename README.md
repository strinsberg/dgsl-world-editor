DGSL World Editor
=================

The DGSL World Editor is a program for building text based adventure games. Worlds built with the editor can be run with the DGSL Text Adventure engine.

## Goal
To allow people to build and share their own text based adventure games without needing to know how to program.

## Status
Along, with the dgsl engine this project is no longer being worked on as of Dec 2020. It was a good experiment with building a world editor, but would require substantial work and documentation to be of use to anyone who didn't contribute to its development, which makes it mostly useless for anything other than a learning experience.

See the DGSL Text Adventure Engine for more information.
