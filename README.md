DGSL World Editor
=================

The DGSL World Editor is a program for building text based adventure games. Worlds built with the editor can be run with the DGSL Text Adventure engine.

## Goal
To allow people to build and share their own text based adventure games without needing to know how to program.

## Status
Development is on hold (Dec 2019) while I continue University, possibley indefinately.

This program is still in early development. It lacks the appropriate documentation to make using it to build custom worlds feasible. It also needs some kind of validation script to discover errors that will prevent worlds from being loaded by the engine.

See the DGSL Text Adventure Engine for more information.
